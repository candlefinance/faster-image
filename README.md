https://github.com/candlefinance/faster-image/assets/12258850/ede91008-4dca-417c-a2ca-4d2177066316

A performant way to render images in React Native with a focus on speed and memory usage. Powered by [Nuke](https://github.com/kean/nuke), the smallest and most performant image loading library for iOS and macOS and [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) on Android.

> The framework is lean and compiles in under 2 secondsÂ¹. Nuke has an automated test suite 2x the size of the codebase itself, ensuring excellent reliability. Every feature is carefully designed and optimized for performance.

> Coil performs a number of optimizations including memory and disk caching, downsampling the image in memory, automatically pausing/cancelling requests, and more.

## Features

- [x] Supports visionOS
- [x] Fast image loading
- [x] Memory and disk caching
- [x] Placeholder support:
  - [x] [blurhash](https://github.com/woltapp/blurhash) (iOS & Android)
  - [x] [thumbhash](https://github.com/evanw/thumbhash) (iOS only)
  - [x] Base64 encoded image
- [x] Animated transition
- [x] Failure image
- [x] Typescript support
- [x] Written in Swift/Kotlin

## To be added

- [ ] GIF support


## Installation

```sh
yarn add @candlefinance/faster-image
```

## Usage

```js
import { FasterImageView, clearCache } from '@candlefinance/faster-image';

<FasterImageView
  style={styles.image}
  onSuccess={(event) => {
    console.log(event.nativeEvent);
  }}
  onError={(event) => console.warn(event.nativeEvent.error)}
  source={{
    transitionDuration: 0.3,
    borderRadius: 50,
    cachePolicy: 'discWithCacheControl',
    showActivityIndicator: true,
    url: 'https://picsum.photos/200/200?random=1',
  }}
/>;

// Clear memory and disk cache
await clearCache();
```
